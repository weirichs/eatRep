Description: Replication methods to compute some basic statistic operations (means, standard deviations,
  frequency tables, percentiles and generalized linear models) in complex survey designs comprising multiple
  imputed variables and/or a clustered sampling structure which both deserve special procedures at least in
  estimating standard errors. See the package documentation for a more detailed description along with references.
