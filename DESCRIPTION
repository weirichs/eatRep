Description: Replication methods to compute some basic statistic operations (means, standard deviations,
  frequency tables, percentiles, mean comparisons using weighted effect coding, generalized linear models,
  and linear multilevel models) in complex survey designs comprising multiple imputed or nested imputed
  variables and/or a clustered sampling structure which both deserve special procedures at least in
  estimating standard errors. See the package documentation for a more detailed description along with references.
