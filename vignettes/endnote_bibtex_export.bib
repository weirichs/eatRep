   abstract = {(from the preface) Cut scores--or what are now more commonly called performance standards--have become more necessary and more consequential. Numerous choices exist for how to derive those performance standards. This book is written for those who must make those choices and for those who conduct, oversee, or are responsible for standard-setting procedures. This book focuses more on the practicalities and "how-to" of standard setting than on the theory or academic concerns that unarguably underlie the practice. The authors' goals in this book are to provide the reader with a brief but solid foundation of the basic theory and logic underlying standard setting, and then to dive directly into a nuts-and-bolts survey of the current inventory of standard-setting methods. This book is organized into three sections. In the first section, the authors address what can be thought of as the fundamentals of standard setting. The second section of the book provides step-by-step activities for actually conducting a standard-setting procedure. The collection of chapters in this section covers each of 13 methods that have at least some degree of current use. The final section of the book describes challenges and likely future directions in standard-setting practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (preface)},

A need for simulation and empirical studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of analytic smoothing techniques for recovering the underlying distribution when sample size, test length, and distributional shape are varied is identified. Studies that examine the question of whether an equating transformation remains the same regardless of the group used to define it are also reviewed. It is concluded that whenever groups differ in level and dispersion of ability, special care must be taken to assure that the anchor test is a miniature of the total test.

   abstract = {It is common practice in IRT to consider items as fixed and persons as random. Both, continuous and categorical person parameters are most often random variables, whereas for items only continuous parameters are used and they are commonly of the fixed type, although exceptions occur. It is shown in the present article that random item parameters make sense theoretically, and that in practice the random item approach is promising to handle several issues, such as the measurement of persons, the explanation of item difficulties, and trouble shooting with respect to DIF. In correspondence with these issues, three parts are included. All three rely on the Rasch model as the simplest model to study, and the same data set is used for all applications. First, it is shown that the Rasch model with fixed persons and random items is an interesting measurement model, both, in theory, and for its goodness of fit. Second, the linear logistic test model with an error term is introduced, so that the explanation of the item difficulties based on the item properties does not need to be perfect. Finally, two more models are presented: the random item profile model (RIP) and the random item mixture model (RIM). In the RIP, DIF is not considered a discrete phenomenon, and when a robust regression approach based on the RIP difficulties is applied, quite good DIF identification results are obtained. In the RIM, no prior anchor sets are defined, but instead a latent DIF class of items is used, so that posterior anchoring is realized (anchoring based on the item mixture). It is shown that both approaches are promising for the identification of DIF. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

   abstract = {Considers G. Rasch's test model for items with 2 answer categories, under the assumption of linear constraints on the item parameters ("linear logistic model"). It is shown that this model is appropriate for the analysis of subject areas in instructional research if the subject area comprises tasks or items which are solved by the pupil by combination of a certain number of cognitive operations or rules. An empirical investigation of this model was conducted with 287 11th graders. Results show that the psychological complexity of problems in elementary differential calculus, as taught in secondary school mathematics, can be approximately explained through the assumption of 7 psychologically meaningful operations. The psychological contribution of this analysis does not lie in a mere statistical description of item difficulties, but rather in the testing of hypotheses concerning which steps (operations) in solving a problem are to be viewed as psychological units. It was seen, for instance, that differentiation of a polynomial is to be considered a single operation psychologically, which is or is not mastered and correctly combined with the other operations, and that the complexity of a task is primarily determined by the combination of different operations and is not increased significantly when the same operation occurs repeatedly within the problem.

   abstract = {In multidimensional item response theory (MIRT), it is possible for the estimate of a subject’s ability in some dimension to decrease after they have answered a question correctly. This paper investigates how and when this type of paradoxical result can occur. We demonstrate that many response models and statistical estimates can produce paradoxical results and that in the popular class of linearly compensatory models, maximum likelihood estimates are guaranteed to do so. In light of these findings, the appropriateness of multidimensional item response methods for assigning scores in high-stakes testing is called into question.},

   abstract = {In operational testing programs using item response theory (IRT), item parameter invariance is threatened when an item appears in a different location on the live test than it did when it was field tested. This study utilizes data from a large state’s assessments to model change in Rasch item difficulty (RID) as a function of item position change, test level, test content, and item format. As a follow-up to the real data analysis, a simulation study was performed to assess the effect of item position change on equating. Results from this study indicate that item position change significantly affects change in RID. In addition, although the test construction procedures used in the investigated state seem to somewhat mitigate the impact of item position change, equating results might be impacted in testing programs where other test construction practices or equating methods are utilized.

The multiple-matrix item sampling designs that provide information about population characteristics most efficiently administer too few responses to students to estimate their proficiencies individually. Marginal estimation procedures, which estimate population characteristics directly from item responses, must be employed to realize the benefits of such a sampling design. Numerical approximations of the appropriate marginal estimation procedures for a broad variety of analyses can be obtained by constructing, from the results of a comprehensive extensive marginal solution, files of plausible values of student proficiencies.

   abstract = {Since the turn of the century, an increasing number of low-stakes assessments (i.e., assessments without direct consequences for the test-takers) are being used to evaluate the quality of educational systems. Internationally, research has shown that low-stakes test results can be biased due to students’ low test-taking motivation and that students’ effort levels can vary throughout a testing session involving both cognitive and noncognitive tests. Thus, it is possible that students’ motivation varies throughout a single cognitive test and in turn affects test performance. This study examines the change in test-taking motivation within a 2-h cognitive low-stakes test and its association with test performance. Based on expectancy-value theory, we assessed three components of test-taking motivation (expectancy for success, value, and effort) and investigated its change. Using data from a large-scale student achievement study of German ninth-graders, we employed second-order latent growth modeling and structural equation modeling to predict test performance in mathematics. On average, students’ effort and perceived value of the test decreased, whereas expectancy for success remained stable. Overall, initial test-taking motivation was a better predictor of test performance than change in motivation. Only the variability of change in the expectancy component was positively related to test performance. The theoretical and practical implications for test practitioners are discussed.},

The authors frame the missing-data problem, review methods, offer advice, and raise issues that remain unresolved. They clear up common misunderstandings regarding the missing at random (MAR) concept. They summarize the evidence against older procedures and, with few exceptions, discourage their use. They present, in both technical and practical language, 2 general approaches that come highly recommended: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian multiple imputation (MI). Newer developments are discussed, including some for dealing with missing data that are not MAR. Although not yet in the mainstream, these procedures may eventually extend the ML and MI methods that currently represent the state of the art.},

   abstract = {This research examined students’ responses to mathematics problem-solving tasks and applied a general multidimensional IRT model at the response category level. In doing so, cognitive processes were identified and modelled through item response modelling to extract more information than would be provided using conventional practices in scoring items. More specifically, the study consisted of two parts. The first part involved the development of a mathematics problem-solving framework that was theoretically grounded, drawing upon research in mathematics education and cognitive psychology. The framework was then used as the basis for item development. The second part of the research involved the analysis of the item response data. It was demonstrated that multidimensional IRT models were powerful tools for extracting information from a limited number of item responses. A problem-solving profile for each student could be constructed from the results of IRT scaling.},
